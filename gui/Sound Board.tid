title: Sound Board

This is an example of a ~SoundPad built with my [[SoundPad|$:/plugins/mklauber/SoundPad]] plugin.  It allows you to mix and match multiple sounds in order to create different effects.  I've packaged the sounds in a separate plugin ([[SoundPad-Sounds|$:/plugins/mklauber/SoundPad-Sounds]]) in order to reduce the minimum size of this plugin.  You can import specific sounds from [[Available Sounds]] or import the plugin to get everything.  

<<sound Roar>>
<<sound [[Horse Galloping (Loop)]] loop="loop">>
<<sound [[Birdsong]] >>
<div style="clear:both;" />
